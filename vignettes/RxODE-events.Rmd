## RxODE: Event coding
Event coding in RxODE is encoded in a single event number `evid`. For
compartments under 100, this is coded as:

- This event is `0` for observation events.
- For a specified compartment a bolus dose is defined as:
  - 100\*(Compartment Number) + 1
  - The dose is then captured in the `amt`
- For IV bolus doses the event is defined as:
   - 10000 + 100\*(Compartment Number) + 1
   - The infusion rate is captured in the `amt` column
   - The infusion is turned off by subtracting `amt` with the same
     `evid` at the stop of the infusion.
	 
	 
For compartments greater or equal to 100, the 100s place and above
digits are transfered to the 100,000th place digit. For doses to the
99th compartment the `evid` for a bolus dose would be `9901` and the
`evid` for an infusion would be `19901`.  For a bolus dose to the
`199`th compartment the `evid` for the bolus dose would be
`109901`. An infusion dosing record for the `199`th compartment would
be `119901`.
